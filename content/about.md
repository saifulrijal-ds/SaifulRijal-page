Data enthusiasts who are open to opportunities to become a professional in a place that offers a positive atmosphere to explore Data Science and Big Data, as well as its application to greater benefits for society. As someone with a background not in IT or Statistics, I started getting to know and studying Data Science by taking bootcamps and related online courses. I realized that the development in the field of technology was very rapid, so in order to pursue the skills I needed, I had to instill a longlife learner mentality.
