# Build Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit and Python
Guided project from Coursera: Build Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit and Python.
In this simple project we are building a machine learning web app. In this web app we can:
1. select a classifier (selecting a model: SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest),
2. adjust the hyperparameter for each classifier,
3. Choose a visualization from the classification metrics.
To know how to run python files in streamlit, please refer to the following [link](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/getting_started.html).
